This package demonstrates a UGV simulated in Unity with a LIDAR that is controlled and monitored through stanadrd ROS2 functions.The repo is split into two halfs, the unity side and teh ROS2 side. The unity side is a standard 3D unity simualtion, all scripts and 3D objects can be found in the assets sub folder. The ROS2 side contains all the nodes required to set up the ROS2 connections and monitors, note only the src file has been uploaded. The ros_control_panel.py is a handy interfaec that makes opening the ROS nodes really simple, simply edit to the programme to reflect your files locations.
